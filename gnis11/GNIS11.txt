  Description:
    Abstract: The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) is the Federal standard for geographic nomenclature. The U.S. Geological Survey developed the GNIS for the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a Federal inter-agency body chartered by public law to maintain uniform feature name usage throughout the Government and to promulgate standard names to the public. The GNIS is the official repository of domestic geographic names data; the official vehicle for geographic names use by all departments of the Federal Government; and the source for applying geographic names to Federal electronic and printed products of all types. See http://geonames.usgs.gov for additional information.
    Purpose: The Geographic Names Information System contains information about physical and cultural geographic features of all types in the United States, associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature classification, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories the geometric boundaries. The database assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. The GNIS collects data from a broad program of partnerships with Federal, State, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The GNIS provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map and feature services, file download services, and customized files upon request.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was created in 1890 and established in its present form by Public Law in 1947 to establish and maintain uniform geographic name usage throughout the Federal Government. The Board serves all government agencies and the public as the central authority to which name inquiries, name issues, and new name proposals can be directed. It is comprised of representatives of Federal agencies associated with land management and cartography. Sharing its responsibilities with the Secretary of the Interior, the Board develops principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of both domestic and foreign geographic names as well as undersea and Antarctic feature names.
      Source data were originally downloaded from the U.S. Board on Geographic Names website (http://geonames.usgs.gov), imported and adapted for redistribution via RIGIS.  Information about how these data were processed are available later in this metadata record under the Data Quality Information section.

        1) Downloaded delimited text file from http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm that was pre-compiled for Rhode Island.
        2) Converted delimited text file to a Microsoft Office 2003 Excel file.  Deleted all records where "State_Alpha" was not equal to RI (note that the source dataset included features where their official locations are outside Rhode Island extend into the state; e.g. the Atlantic Ocean).  Deleted all records that did not have official feature locations associated with them.  Certain field names were truncated to match shapefile field name length limitations.
        3) Created XY Event Layer within Esri ArcGIS v10, exported layer to a shapefile that uses the Rhode Island State Plane coordinate system.
        4) Imported original metadata document written by USGS (available via http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/metadata.htm), deleted non-pertinent information, and supplemented with additional field definition information available from this website.  Metadata record updated with additional citation, file format, data quality, and distribution information.

Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Detailed_Description:
    Entity_Type:
      Entity_Type_Label: Geographic feature
      Entity_Type_Definition: A geographic feature is any relatively permanent part of the natural or manmade landscape or seascape that has recognizable identity within a particular cultural context. The primary attributes of a geographic feature are name and location.
      Entity_Type_Definition_Source: Principles, Policies, and Procedures: Domestic Geographic Names, By Donald J. Orth, Executive Secretary, Domestic Geographic Names (emeritus) and Roger L. Payne, Executive Secretary, United States Board on Geographic Names and Domestic Geographic Names, Third printing (revised) and Preliminary Online Edition, 1997 (http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/pro_pol_pro.pdf).
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: FEATURE_ID
      Attribute_Definition: A permanent, unique number assigned to a geographic feature for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying that feature as a record in any information system database, dataset, file, or document and for distinguishing it from all other feature records so identified. The number is assigned sequentially (highest existing number plus one) to new records as they are created in the Geographic Names Information System. The number, by design, carries no information or association to the content of the feature record and therefore is not subject to change as attribute values change. Once assigned to a feature, the number is never changed or withdrawn, and never reassigned. The Feature ID can be applied in conjunction with system-unique record identifiers in any database or system, thus providing a national standard common reference identifier across multiple datasets. The Feature ID is stored in the GNIS database as an integer with a maximum of ten digits.

      Attribute_Definition: A geographic feature name and its written form and application approved or recognized as official by the United States Board on Geographic Names for use throughout the Federal Government. The official name is established either by policy or by decision of the Board on Geographic Names. It is the proper name, specific term, or expression by which a particular geographic entity is, or was, known. A geographic feature may have only one official name, which must be the name applied to the feature on all Federal products, electronic or printed.

      Attribute_Label: FEAT_CLASS
      Attribute_Definition: A feature class is a designation for a group of features in a broadly defined descriptive category. All features are assigned to one and only one class. They do not individually classify all kinds of cultural and natural features. By design, there are no Federal or industry standards or guidelines for feature classification. These classifications originally were developed for mainframe file structure search purposes. Although the terms are generally consistent with dictionary definitions, they may not conform exactly and are not always intuitive.
